# Chatlas Backend

## Inspiration

Chatlas is inspired by the growing need for seamless communication in a globalized world where language differences often create barriers. We wanted to build a tool that connects people across languages—whether for casual chats, international collaboration, or community engagement—making it feel like everyone is speaking the same language.

## What It Does

Chatlas is a real-time group chat web application that automatically translates messages into the preferred language of each participant. The backend handles user authentication, real-time messaging, translation processing, and database management to ensure a smooth experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Powered by WebSockets (Socket.IO) for instant communication.
- **Auto-Translation**: Messages are translated in real time using Azure AI Translator to match the recipient's language preference.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Users can convert their voice to text using Azure Speech Service.
- **Secure Authentication**: Sign-in and sign-up with Google OAuth, using JWT for session handling.
- **Invite System**: Every chat room generates a unique link that users can share to invite others.
- **Persistent History**: Rooms are persistent—users can leave and return later with full message history preserved.
- **Lazy Load Messages**: Older messages are loaded on scroll, improving performance and user experience, especially in large conversations.

## How We Built It
We developed Chatlas using a full-stack approach:

- **Frontend**: React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS for UI/UX.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js handle the API and real-time socket connections.
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL stores user, room, and message data.
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth2 with JWT-based sessions ensures security.
- **AI Services**: Azure Translator for real-time multilingual support, Azure Speech Service for converting speech to text.
- **Development Tools**: We used GitHub Copilot throughout development to boost our productivity and streamline code generation.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The app uses a Client-Server architecture, with WebSocket (Socket.IO) handling real-time communication. Each message is first stored in its original language, then translated and delivered to users in their chosen language. The system supports language preference changes mid-conversation, affecting only future messages.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Successfully built a full-stack chat app with auto-translation.
- Integrated Azure AI services for both text translation and speech-to-text.
- Achieved seamless sign-in/sign-up flow with Google OAuth and secure sessions.
- Built a robust invitation system with dynamic room links and user management.

## What We Learned
- How to work with Azure Cognitive Services (Translation & Speech APIs).
- Setting up OAuth with secure session handling using JWT.
- Collaborative full-stack development using GitHub and Copilot.
- Handling WebSocket communication for real-time updates.

## What's Next for Chatlas
- Add support for chat summarization using Azure OpenAI.
- Implement file sharing in rooms (or emotes sending).
- Improve testing coverage and CI/CD pipeline.
- Add analytics to understand language usage and user behavior.
- Explore additional security enhancements and performance optimizations.
- Deployment on Azure with Docker containers.

## Running the Backend

To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/MinhhQuangg/Azure_App_BE.git
cd Azure_App_BE
```

**2. Create a .env File**

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
DB_HOST= <DB_HOST>
# [Name of PostgreSQL database server].postgres.database.azure.com
DB_USER=<DB_USER>
DB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>
DB_NAME=postgres
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://DB_USER:DB_PASSWORD@<DB_HOST>:5432/postgres?schema=public"
AZURE_TRANS_KEY=<TRANS_KEY>
VITE_TRANS_KEY=<TRANS_KEY>
AZURE_TRANS_LOCATION=eastus
VITE_TRANS_REGION=eastus
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
SESSION_SECRET=<SESSION_SECRET>
JWT_SECRET=<JWT_SECRET>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
```

**3. Install Dependencies**

```
npm install
```

**4. Start the Server**

```
npm start
```

## Connect with Frontend to Run the Full App
To run Chatlas fully, set up the frontend by following instructions in the **[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/MinhhQuangg/Azure_Hack_FE)**.

## Note
Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB/PostgreSQL set up before running the backend server.
